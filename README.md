# Dockerfiles

These are my Dockerfiles.  I run a load of my apps in Docker on my laptop to separate work apps
home directory and so on from my personal stuff.  I also use Docker as a convenient way to have
apps automatically restart.  Two of the images `key_presses` and `media_keys` are experiments with
containerising long running DTrace scripts.  The former counts how many key strokes I have made in
a day and the latter intercepts presses on my media keys to start/stop my music.
